        <h1>About the Studios</h1>
        <p>We are a small group of engineers who are passionate about technology. 
        We started this small studio to be able to follow our passion in developing
        ideas and making new and improve solutions to problems without dealing with
        the bureaucracy that plagues most organizations. This leaves us more time to
        pursue and focus our efforts into the projects we take.</p>
        <p>We have decided to open up some of our services to the world. We offer all
        kinds of technical services from consulting, user experience design, 
        software migration to building websites, mobile applications such as iOS and
        more. We are also interested in ubiquitous computing projects. If you 
        any technical services or just need a website or app, please 
        contact us. With our background in engineering and technology, we can probably help.</p>

        <p>Hello, my name is Bruce Burgess. I am the founder of Red Raven 
        Computing Studios. I have always been fascinated by computers ever since
        I was a child. I started my computer journey by using DOS and by playing a game
        called Zork. I also like Nintendo growing up. I started to familiarize 
        myself with widows and helped my local elementary school's librarian with computers when I was 
        in elementary. This curiosity and interest is still with me today.</p>
        <p>I have earned a BS in Electrical Engineering with honors from University
        of Nevada, Reno and earned a Masters of Engineering from Chung Ang University
        from Seoul, Korea. I am a bit of a globetrotter as I have traveled and lived
        in several different countries in Asia. I have worked in Japan as an iOS
        Developer and System Consultant and I have also did some iOS development
        in Vietnam.</p>
        <p>My current interests now are using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, 
        and other web technologies in building websites and mobile applications
        as well as iOS development using Xcode, Swift, and Objective C and
        Android development using Android Studios. I also interested in 
        using Java in some application. I have some experience with C++. I have 
        studied about user experience design as well. I am particular interested
        in getting into ubiquitous computing development which my education can
        really help in.</p>
