        <h1>Welcome to Red Raven Computing Studios</h1>
        <p>Thank you for visiting us. We are glad you are here. We view 
            computing and coding as an art form. We design and build 
            websites, write mobile applications, and other computing 
            solutions. We are also interested in ubiquitous development 
            as well. 
        </p>
        <p>With our technical knowledge and experiences we also consult 
            on all kinds of matters related to Information Technology and 
            Computing. So, let us know if you need an extra hand with a 
            project. 
        </p>
        <p>When you contact us, you will be communicating with an American, 
            whose first language is English. So no frustration with 
            communicating to someone who doesnâ€™t understand English or has 
            a heavy accent you cannot understand.   
        </p>
