        <h1>What We Are About</h1>
        <p>
            Thank you for visiting us. We are glad you are here. We started this
            because we are passionate about working with technology.  We view 
            computing and coding as an art form. We design and build 
            websites, write mobile applications, and other computing 
            solutions. We are also interested in ubiquitous development 
            as well. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It can be difficult finding someone to write a mobile app or to 
            help you with developing a technical project. 
            Outsourcing overseas to places like India can be riddled with 
            problems, such as poor communication or poor quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            So whether you have an idea for a mobile app, need a website for 
            your small business, or if you donâ€™t really know how to start a 
            project in computing, even if you have limited budget or have no 
            money at all, do not let that hold you back from achieving your goals. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Contact us and let us use our technical knowledge and skills to 
            help make your dreams a reality. 
        </p>
